-- Task 1: Write a SQL statement to create the OrdersView Virtual table based on the Orders table. 
-- The table must include the following columns: Order ID, Quantity and Cost. 
-- Once you have executed the query, select all data from the OrdersView table. 
-- The expected output result should be the same as the following screenshot 
-- (assuming that you have created and populated the table correctly).

CREATE VIEW OrderView AS SELECT OrderID, Quantity, Cost FROM Orders;
SELECT * FROM OrderView;

-- Task 2: Write a SQL statement that utilizes the ‘OrdersView’ virtual table to Update the base Orders table. 
-- In the UPDATE TABLE statement, change the cost to 200 where the order id equals 2. 
-- Once you have executed the query, select all data from the OrdersView table. 
-- The expected output result should be the same as the following screenshot 
-- (assuming that you have created and populated the table correctly).

UPDATE OrderView SET Cost =200 WHERE OrderID=2; 
SELECT * FROM OrderView;

-- Task 3: Write a SQL statement that changes the name of the ‘OrdersView’ virtual table to ClientsOrdersView.
RENAME TABLE OrderView to ClientsOrderView;
SELECT * FROM ClientsOrderView;

-- Task 4: Write a SQL statement to delete the Orders virtual table.
